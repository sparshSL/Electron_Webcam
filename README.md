# Electron_Webcam
A webcam app to take live feed and can toggle the video to black and white while also proving a save image option.

1. Please clone the repository in VScode
2. Install electron using 
    - npm install electron --save-dev
        As i am having trouble uploading node_modules folder this code will generate the necessary files
3. Run the application using
    - npm start

I have also put a compressed file (dist.rar) that is the packaged version of the app with a .exe file to directly run the application
